# Death Sentences Visualization Project

## Overview
This project utilizes D3.js and vanilla JavaScript to visualize the number of people sentenced to death in the United States over time. The visualization is presented in three main ways:

1. **US Map:** The data is represented on a map of the US, showing state-wise division of death sentences.
2. **Gender Bar Chart:** A bar chart depicting the distribution of death sentences by gender.
3. **Race Pie Chart:** A pie chart illustrating the distribution of death sentences by race.

These visualizations are controlled by a slider that adjusts the time interval from 1976 to 2016 in four-year increments. Additionally, the webpage displays information about the US president during the selected time period, including their political party affiliation.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to conduct data exploration and visualization to identify trends between the ruling political party and the number of inmates sentenced to death by race, gender, and state in the United States.
